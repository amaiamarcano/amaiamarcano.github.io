  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>My name is Amaia MARCANO LARRINAGA. I have a BSc. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.<br>
    In Summer 2021, at the end of my Bachelor, I did a traineeship with ICMAT's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics research group in Madrid.<br>
    I'm passionate about non linear dynamics and chaos.<br>
    When my health gets better, I hope I can finish my Masters and do a PhD.</p>
